== Setting up test environment

Requires *Go 1.14*

Testing happens with the above version. Developers are advised to stick to this version.

Unit test does not require any precondition, run `make test` to validate unit tests.   

== Tests

*Prerequisites for OpenShift cluster:*

* A `crc` environment for 4.* local cluster:
+
Follow link:https://github.com/code-ready/crc#documentation[`crc`] installation guide.
+
OR
* A 4.* cluster hosted remotely

NOTE: Make sure that `kam` and `oc` binaries are in `$PATH`. Use the cloned kam directory to launch tests on 4.* clusters. 4.* cluster needs to be configured before launching the tests against it. The files `kubeadmin-password` and `kubeconfig` which contain cluster login details should be present in the `auth` directory and it should reside in the same directory as `Makefile`. If it is not present in the auth directory, please create it. Then run `make prepare-test-cluster` to configure the 4.* cluster. `make prepare-test-cluster` comprises installation of sealed secrets, openshift pipelines, argocd operator and create sealed secrets instance.

*E2e tests:*
